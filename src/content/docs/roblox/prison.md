The game has been taken down for obvious reasons. There is a [GameRant Article](https://gamerant.com/roblox-weird-prison-game-traps-players/) detailing the game.

This was just a funny idea I came up with one day and made into a game within a few hours. The game abuses Teleport Service to attempt to prevent the player from leaving the game. It also features a shop in which players can purchase gears with points earned every minute.
